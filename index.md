### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    One of my favorite labs throughout the course would be lab 10 of part 2. It introduced me to a list of countries were the objective of the lab was to create a table that contains data about California's country population in which the program would print out the population after identifing what country it was being asked. I found this lab fun because I got to look at a list of data and make a program that was able to analyze the data and print out an output. Although most of the work was initializing values and and printing strings of text, I found the 2D vector fun to look at.

* Lab 7

    Throughout the entirety of the lab course, my favorite lab was Lab 7, specifically part 1. This was the initial lab where I used a lot of content I liked using such as a vector, string, and even mathematical functions. It was fun basically making a calculator to calculate the amount of days between each specific date given. Moreover, this was the lab that had a lot of initialization as well as different files within one lab. This was the first lab that made me look into different files and explore what each file had to have. Such as datediff.cc which included a lot of initalization of variables while datediff_functions.cc had a lot of mathematical functions implemented.

* Lab 11

    One of my favorite labs throughout the course would be lab 11 of part 1. This was the lab that introduced the use of classes in C++. Where during the lab, we were required to make a class that would hold values of what the pizza is made of and what it looks like on the menu. It had the calories, size, and the name. It was interesting to find how a menu would work based on the use of class using different files to hold data for the pizza menu.
