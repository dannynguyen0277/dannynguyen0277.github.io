### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Throughout the entirety of the lab course, my favorite lab was Lab 7, specifically part 1. This was the initial lab where I used a lot of content I liked using such as a vector, string, and even mathematical functions. It was fun basically making a calculator to calculate the amount of days between each specific date given.
